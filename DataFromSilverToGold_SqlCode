-- Created Storage Account 'olistdsaccount' and inside that the Container 'olistdata'
-- Created Azure Data Lake, there are three folders in 'olistdata' -> bronze, silver and gold
-- From different sources like Github url and Sql table, stored the data to Azure Data Factory using Pipeline to bronze
-- Using notebook in Databrick, I have transformed the bronze data and stored it in silver in 'PARQUET' format


-- Finally, using Azure Synapse for converting data silver to gold
-- Read data from silver
